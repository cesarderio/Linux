# Configuring and Restoring Linux VM Backups in Microsoft Azure Cloud

<br>

## Overview

- **Focus**: Backing up and restoring Linux-based Virtual Machines (VMs) in Microsoft Azure Cloud.
- **Key Requirement**: A Recovery Services vault in the same location as the VMs to be backed up.

### Steps to Configure VM Backups in Azure

1. **Set Up Recovery Services Vault**:
   - Filter resources to show only Recovery Services vaults.
   - Ensure the vault is in the same region as the VMs.

2. **Backup Policy Configuration**:
   - Access VM properties and navigate to 'Backup'.
   - Select or create a Recovery Services vault.
   - Choose backup policy type (e.g., Standard, Enhanced).
   - Define backup frequency and retention periods.

3. **Select VMs for Backup**:
   - Add VMs to the backup policy.
   - Include OS and data disks in the backup.
   - Option to automatically include future disks added to the VM.

4. **Enabling Backup**:
   - Initiate the backup process.
   - On-demand backups can be triggered anytime.

5. **Monitoring Backup Status**:
   - Use notification center or VM properties to track backup progress.
   - Check the 'Backup Jobs' page for detailed status.

### Restoring Backed Up VMs

- **Access Backup Center**: Use the VM's backup tab to access the Backup Center.
- **Restore Options**: Once backup is complete, options like 'Restore VM' and 'File Recovery' will be available.
- **File Recovery**: For specific file or folder restoration.
- **VM Restoration**: To revert the entire VM to a backed-up state.

### Key Considerations

- **Location Consistency**: Ensure that the VM and Recovery Services vault are in the same Azure region.
- **Backup Policy Customization**: Tailor backup policies according to VM usage and requirements.
- **Automated vs Manual Backup**: Leverage automated backups for regular intervals or manual backups for specific needs.
- **Resource Monitoring**: Keep an eye on backup progress and completion to ensure data integrity.

### Conclusion

Understanding the process of backing up and restoring Linux-based VMs in Microsoft Azure is essential for maintaining data integrity and system reliability. Azure's Recovery Services vault offers a comprehensive and flexible platform for managing VM backups, ensuring that critical data can be recovered swiftly and securely in case of failures or data loss incidents.
