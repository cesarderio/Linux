# Working with Snapshots in On-Premises Virtual Machine Solutions

<br>

## **Overview**

- **Purpose**: Understanding how to work with snapshots in on-premises virtual machine (VM) environments like VMware Workstation.
- **Importance**: Snapshots provide a way to revert VMs to earlier states, which is crucial for testing, configuration changes, and backup purposes.

### **Steps to Configure VM Snapshots**

1. **Access VM Settings**:
   - Navigate to VM settings in the virtualization solution (e.g., VMware Workstation).
   - View virtual hardware configurations.

2. **Taking a Snapshot**:
   - Go to VM and select Snapshot.
   - Choose to take a snapshot or manage existing ones.
   - Enter snapshot details (e.g., name, description).
   - Be consistent in naming and detailing snapshots for clarity.

3. **Snapshot Characteristics**:
   - Captures disk contents, VM configuration, and state of what's happening in memory.
   - Subsequent snapshots capture changes from the previous one.

4. **Snapshot Management**:
   - Use Snapshot Manager to view snapshot history.
   - Options to take additional snapshots or revert to previous ones.
   - Set up AutoProtect for automatic snapshot creation based on frequency.

5. **Cloning vs. Snapshotting**:
   - Cloning creates an independent copy of the VM.
   - Cloning requires VM to be powered off, unlike snapshotting.

6. **Snapshot Storage Considerations**:
   - Monitor disk space on the hypervisor host, as snapshots consume disk capacity.

7. **Shutdown and Snapshot**:
   - Consider shutting down the VM for snapshotting if feasible.
   - Shutdown leads to quicker snapshot creation due to reduced active processes.

### Key Considerations

- **Snapshot vs Clone**: Snapshot retains the state of the VM, while cloning creates a separate, independent copy.
- **Snapshot Management**: Regularly review and manage snapshots to optimize storage usage and avoid disk space issues.
- **Usage Scenarios**: Ideal for backup, testing configurations, and restoring VMs to a specific state in case of issues or changes.

## Conclusion

Understanding the process of creating and managing snapshots in on-premises VM solutions is crucial for effective VM administration. It offers a flexible and reliable method for safeguarding VM states, facilitating testing, and ensuring system stability.
