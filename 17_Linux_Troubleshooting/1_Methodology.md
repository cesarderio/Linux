# Linux Troubleshooting Methodology

<br>

## 1. Identify the Problem

- **Understanding the Issue**: Determine if the issue has occurred before and if there is existing documentation or knowledge base to reference.
- **Scope Assessment**: Analyze the extent of the problem - whether it's isolated to a single Linux host or a network-wide issue.
- **Reproducibility**: Check if the problem can be consistently duplicated to confirm its existence.

<br>

## 2. Establish a Theory of Probable Cause

- **Start Simple**: Begin with checking the most obvious potential causes (e.g., rebooting a sluggish server, checking network cables).
  - **Consult Resources**: Use knowledge base articles and internal ticketing systems to develop a theory.
  - **Prioritize Theories**: Rank potential causes based on likelihood and available evidence.

<br>

## 3. Test the Theory

- **One Change at a Time**: Implement changes individually to accurately identify the root cause.
  - **Process Under Pressure**: Despite urgency, methodically test each theory to ensure accurate identification of the issue.

<br>

## 4. Establish a Plan of Action

- **Backout Plan**: Prepare for the possibility of needing to revert changes (e.g., take snapshots of virtual machines).
  - **Change Management**: Document changes, seek approval, and plan a schedule for implementation.
  - **Stakeholder Communication**: Inform affected parties about the planned solution and any potential impact.

<br>

## 5. Verify Functionality and Document the Result

- **Test Post-Implementation**: Confirm that the solution resolved the issue without introducing new problems.
  - **Preventative Measures**: Implement strategies to prevent future occurrences or to mitigate impact.
  - **Documentation**: Record the issue, the solution process, and the outcome in an internal knowledge base for future reference.
