# CPU and Memory Troubleshooting in Linux

<br>

## Understanding Hardware and Software Aspects

- **Hardware Configuration**: Modern components are solid-state and configured through BIOS/UEFI or software.
- **Hardware Failure**: Rare, but mostly due to environmental factors like overheating.

<br>

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **Incompatibility with Linux OS**: Ensure compatibility with the specific version of the Linux distribution.
- **Overheating and CPU Throttling**: Monitor and maintain appropriate temperature levels in data centers or server rooms.
- **dmesg Command**: Use `dmesg` to view kernel log events and check for hardware detection and errors.
- **ps Command**: Utilize `ps aux` to view all running processes and their CPU and memory usage.
- **Top Command**: Leverage the `top` command to monitor real-time resource usage by processes.
- **Performance Baselines**: Establish specific performance baselines for hosts based on their workload.

## Adjusting Resources in Virtual Environments

- **Resizing Virtual Machines**: Modify VM settings for CPU and RAM in cloud environments (e.g., Microsoft Azure) to match workload requirements.

<br>

## Key Considerations

- **Hardware Configurations**: Less common as a source of problems compared to software issues.
- **Environmental Factors**: Crucial in maintaining hardware longevity and performance.
- **Software Compatibility**: Vital to match hardware with the Linux distribution's version.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Essential for identifying resource-heavy processes and taking action.
- **Adaptability**: Ability to resize and adjust resources in virtual environments to meet changing demands.
