# Monitoring CPU Performance in Linux

<br>

## Essential Commands and Tools for CPU Monitoring

1. **Using `top` Command**:
   - Displays top processes by CPU usage.
   - Real-time updating; customizable update intervals.

2. **Exploring `htop` Command**:
   - Interactive version of `top`.
   - Allows sorting by CPU usage and other metrics.
   - Provides an overall CPU usage indicator.

3. **Applying `ps` Command**:
   - Shows all running processes and their CPU usage.
   - Can be redirected to a file for historical data.

4. **Utilizing `uptime` Command**:
   - Provides information on system uptime and load average.

5. **Inspecting with `lscpu` Command**:
   - Lists detailed CPU information including architecture, number of CPUs, model, speed, and virtualization capabilities.

6. **Analyzing with `mpstat` Command**:
   - Offers statistics on all CPUs.
   - Useful for evaluating idle and usage percentages.

## Key Considerations in CPU Monitoring

- **Understanding Workload and Baselines**:
  - Establishing a performance baseline is essential to discern normal from abnormal CPU usage.
  - Spikes in CPU usage might be normal depending on the workload.

- **Monitoring in Virtual Environments**:
  - CPU performance can also be monitored in virtual environments like Microsoft Azure.
  - Azure provides tools for viewing CPU averages and historical data.

- **Rebooting as a Troubleshooting Step**:
  - Sometimes, rebooting the server (e.g., using `sudo init 6`) can resolve CPU performance issues.
  - Rebooting is particularly useful when the system is too overworked to respond efficiently to commands.

## Conclusion

Effective CPU monitoring in Linux involves a combination of real-time analysis and historical data evaluation. Tools like `top`, `htop`, `ps`, `uptime`, `lscpu`, and `mpstat` provide comprehensive insights into CPU usage and performance. Understanding the specific workload and establishing performance baselines are crucial for accurate interpretation of CPU metrics.
