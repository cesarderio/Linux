## Common Linux Shells

1. **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**:
   - Default shell in most Linux distributions.
   - Enhanced version of the original Bourne shell (`sh`).
   - Supports scripting, job control, and command completion.

2. **Tcsh (Enhanced C Shell)**:
   - Extension of the original C shell (`csh`).
   - Known for its interactive features like spell check and command history.

3. **Zsh (Z Shell)**:
   - Combines features from Bash and Tcsh.
   - Offers robust theme and plugin support, making it popular for customization.

4. **Ksh (Korn Shell)**:
   - Incorporates features from both Bash and C shell.
   - Known for its efficiency in scripting.

5. **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)**:
   - User-friendly shell with advanced features for interactive use.
   - Includes syntax highlighting and autosuggestions.
