# Configuring Linux Routing in the Cloud Using Azure Route Tables

<br>

## Introduction

- **Objective**: Learn how to configure cloud-based routing for Linux VMs in Microsoft Azure.
- **Host**: Dan Lachance demonstrates the process of configuring cloud routing in Azure.

## Steps for Configuring Cloud Routing in Azure

1. **Accessing Azure Portal**:
   - Login to Microsoft Azure and navigate to the Virtual machines section.
   - Identify the virtual machine (e.g., Ubuntu1) to configure routing for.

2. **Examining Network Settings**:
   - Access the networking settings of the VM to determine its virtual network and subnet.

3. **Creating a Route Table**:
   - In Azure, go to 'Create a resource' and search for 'Route table'.
   - Create a new route table in the desired resource group and region.

4. **Configuring Route Table**:
   - After creation, access the route table's properties to add routes.
   - Add a route to direct traffic to specific destinations, such as a firewall appliance.
   - Set the destination type (e.g., IP Addresses) and specify the destination range (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0 for default route).
   - Choose 'Virtual appliance' as the next hop type and input the firewall's internal IP address.

5. **Associating Route Table with Subnet**:
   - Associate the newly created route table with the relevant subnet (e.g., default subnet in Ubuntu1-vnet).
   - Ensure that the route table is properly linked to the subnet to direct VM traffic accordingly.

6. **Verifying Configuration**:
   - Check the subnet's properties to confirm the association of the route table.
   - All VMs in the associated subnet will now use the defined routes in the route table.

## Practical Applications

- **Cloud Network Management**: Setting up routing in Azure to manage traffic flow of Linux VMs.
- **Security Enhancement**: Directing VM traffic through security appliances like firewalls.
- **Customized Routing**: Tailoring cloud network traffic paths to meet specific organizational needs.

## Summary

- **Cloud Routing Skills**: Understanding how to set up and manage routing tables in Azure is essential for cloud network configuration.
- **Impact on VMs**: The routing configurations impact all VMs within the associated subnet, guiding their traffic through predefined paths.
