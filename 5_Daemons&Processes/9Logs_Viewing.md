## Exploring Log Files

1. **Common Log Files**:
   - `auth.log`: Contains authorization information, like user logins.
   - `dmesg`: Kernel ring buffer messages, useful for hardware and driver issues.
   - `kern.log`: Kernel logs, important for deeper system analysis.
   - `syslog`: General system activity log, capturing a wide range of events.
   - `faillog`, `lastlog`: Record failed login attempts and last logins respectively.
