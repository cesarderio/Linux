# Kubernetes and Docker Application Containers

<br>

## Introduction to Kubernetes

- **Definition**: Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Cluster-Based**: It operates based on a cluster of nodes (virtual machines) to support containerized applications.

<br>

## Deployment Options

- **On-Premises and Cloud**: Kubernetes can be deployed both on-premises and in cloud environments.
- **Ease of Cloud Deployment**: Cloud deployments are popular due to easier setup and management compared to on-premises installations.

<br>

## Core Features of Kubernetes

1. **Autoscaling**:
   - Adjusts the number of worker nodes and application containers based on workload, such as data feed intensity or user requests.
2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Distributes workload evenly across deployed containers to handle increased traffic or compute requirements.
3. **Desired State Management**:
   - Ensures a predefined state of the cluster (e.g., specific number of virtual machines) is maintained, with autohealing for failed nodes.
4. **Containerized App Updates**:
   - Facilitates updates to applications without downtime, especially in multi-container setups.

## Kubernetes in Action

<br>

### Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster

- **Configuration**: Involves selecting Kubernetes version, configuring node pool, node size, and scaling options.
- **Deployment**: Can be done via command-line or through a GUI, often provided in cloud services.

<br>

### Working with Kubernetes Pods

- **Pod Definition**: A pod can run one or more containers based on specified container images.
- **Deployment Method**: Typically deployed using a YAML configuration file.

<br>

### Communication and Management

- **Kubelet Process**: Facilitates communication between worker nodes and the cluster service node.
- **Cluster Service Node**: Maintains the overall configuration and health of the Kubernetes cluster.

<br>

## Deploying Applications in Kubernetes

<br>

### Creating the Cluster

- **Tools**: Command-line tools like kubelet, kubeadm, and kubectl are commonly used.
- **Initial Configuration**: Using `kubectl`, configure the cluster (e.g., `kubectl config set-cluster`).

<br>

### Deploying Containerized Apps

- **Application Deployment**: Deploy applications using `kubectl apply -f [config_file.yml]`.
- **Cluster Management**: Centrally manage the cluster nodes and applications.

## Conclusion

Kubernetes provides a robust framework for managing large-scale containerized applications, offering features like autoscaling, load balancing, and autohealing. It's suitable for various uses, from front-end user applications to back-end data processing tasks. Kubernetes simplifies the complexities associated with running containerized applications, making it a vital tool in modern application deployment and management.
