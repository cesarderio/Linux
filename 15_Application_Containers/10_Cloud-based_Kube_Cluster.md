# Deploying a Cloud-Based Kubernetes Cluster in Azure

<br>

## Overview of Cloud-Based Kubernetes Deployment

- **Managed Service**: Opting for a cloud-based Kubernetes service like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) reduces the complexity of managing the underlying infrastructure.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for scenarios where complete control over virtual machines isn't necessary.

<br>

## Steps for Deploying Kubernetes in Azure

<br>

### Initiating the Kubernetes Service

1. **Accessing Azure Portal**: Start by logging into the Microsoft Azure portal.
2. **Creating a Resource**: Select "Create a resource" and search for Kubernetes.
3. **Selecting AKS**: Choose Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for the deployment.

<br>

### Configuring the Kubernetes Cluster

1. **Resource Group Assignment**: Deploy the service into a specific resource group.
2. **Cluster Configuration**:
   - Choose a cluster preset configuration.
   - Name the cluster (e.g., `mykubernetescluster172`).
   - Select the deployment region (e.g., East US).
3. **Kubernetes Version**: Decide on the version of Kubernetes based on application requirements.
4. **Node Configuration**:
   - Set the size of the nodes (virtual machines).
   - Configure autoscaling with a defined node count range.

<br>

### Finalizing and Creating the Cluster

1. **Review and Create**: Validate the configurations and create the Kubernetes cluster.
2. **Deployment Completion**: After a brief waiting period, the deployment will be completed.

<br>

## Post-Deployment Actions

<br>

### Exploring Cluster Properties

- **Resource Navigation**: Use the "Go to resource" or "All resources" view to explore various Kubernetes-related resources like Load balancers, VM scale sets, etc.

<br>

### Connecting to the Cluster

- **Access Methods**: Utilize the Azure portal's Cloud Shell or Azure CLI for cluster management.
- **Cluster Access Configuration**: Follow provided instructions to set up and access cluster credentials.

<br>

## Command-Line Management of Kubernetes Cluster

<br>

### Using Azure Cloud Shell

1. **Initialization**: Create storage for persistent
script storage if using Cloud Shell for the first time.
2. **Alternative Deployment**: Optionally, deploy a Kubernetes cluster directly from the command line using `az aks create`.

<br>

### Accessing and Managing the Cluster

1. **Getting Credentials**: Use `az aks get-credentials` to merge cluster credentials into the kube config file.
2. **Node Verification**: Utilize `kubectl get nodes` to verify the availability of nodes within the cluster.

<br>

## Conclusion

Deploying a Kubernetes cluster in Azure as a managed service simplifies the process of setting up and managing containerized applications. It offers a balance between ease of use and robustness, suitable for a wide range of applications from web services to data analytics. Utilizing Azure's AKS provides a streamlined approach to harnessing the power of Kubernetes without the complexity of manual setup and configuration.
