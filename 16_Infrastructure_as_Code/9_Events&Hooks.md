# Managing Git Hooks: Automating Git Events

<br>

## Introduction to Git Hooks

- **Git Hooks**: Scripts that are triggered by specific Git events, allowing automation of certain tasks during the software development lifecycle.
- **Purpose**: Used to automate tasks like testing, compiling, or sending notifications at specific points in the Git workflow.

## Setting Up and Managing Hooks

1. **Navigating to the Hooks Directory**:
   - Use `ls -a` to view all items in a Git repository, including the hidden `.git` directory.
   - Navigate to the `.git/hooks` directory, which contains sample hook scripts.

2. **Understanding Hook Scripts**:
   - Sample scripts (e.g., `prepare-commit-msg.sample`) are provided for various Git events but are ignored by default due to the `.sample` extension.
   - Hooks can be activated by removing the `.sample` extension.

3. **Creating a Custom Hook**:
   - Example: Activating the `prepare-commit-msg` hook.
   - Use `mv prepare-commit-msg.sample prepare-commit-msg` to rename the file and remove the `.sample` extension.
   - Edit the hook script (e.g., using `nano prepare-commit-msg`) to customize its behavior.

## Example: Customizing the Prepare-Commit-Msg Hook

1. **Adding Custom Code to the Hook Script**:
   - Open the script with a text editor like nano: `sudo nano prepare-commit-msg`.
   - Add custom shell script code, such as `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "My customized git hook message!"`.

2. **Testing the Hook**:
   - Return to the main repository directory: `cd ../..`.
   - Make changes in the repository (e.g., create a new file and add it with `git add`).
   - Commit the changes: `git commit -m "test commit"`.
   - Observe the customized message from the hook script during the commit process.

## Conclusion

Git hooks provide a powerful mechanism to automate actions in response to various Git events, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of software development workflows. By customizing hooks, developers can streamline processes, ensure consistency, and integrate additional actions like testing or notifications into their Git operations.
