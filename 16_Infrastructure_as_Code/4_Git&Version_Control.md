# Understanding Git and Version Control in CI/CD and IaC

<br>

## Introduction to Git and Version Control

- **Git**: An open-source file version control tool available on multiple platforms, often pre-installed in modern Linux distributions.
- **Purpose**: Allows for tracking and managing changes to files, commonly used for software development and configuration files.

## Distinction Between Git and GitHub

- **Git vs. GitHub**:
   - Git is a version control tool.
   - GitHub is a website and a collection of tools that integrate with Git, offering public and private repositories for code and file version control.

## Version Control and Its Importance

- **Functionality**: Version control enables tracking who modified files, when, and what changes were made.
- **Checkout and Commit Process**: Allows developers to check out code segments for modification and then commit the changes for integration.
- **Accountability and Audit Trail**: Provides a historical record of changes to files within a project.

## Key Terminology in Git

1. **Repository**: A subdirectory containing project files.
2. **Staged Files**: Files ready to be committed to the repository.
3. **Commit**: Act of submitting changes for tracking in the repository.
4. **Branch**: A version or variation of a repository.
5. **Clone**: A synchronized copy of a repository.
6. **Fork**: A standalone copy of a repository without synchronization.

## Utilizing Git Commands

- **Help Command**: `git help --all` to view available Git subcommands.
- **Configuring Git**: Set user name with `git config --global user.name "username"`.
- **Creating Repositories**: Use `git init` for creating new repositories.
- **Adding Files**: Add files to a repository with `git add filename`.
- **Committing Changes**: Commit changes with `git commit -m "commit message"`.
- **Checking Status and Logs**: Use `git status` and `git log` for current status and change logs.

## Application of Git in CI/CD and IaC

- **CI/CD Integration**: Git integrates into Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for efficient software development and deployment.
- **IaC Management**: Essential for managing Infrastructure as Code files, ensuring consistent and error-free infrastructure deployments.
