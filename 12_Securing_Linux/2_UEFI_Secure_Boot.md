# Understanding UEFI and Secure Boot in Linux Systems

<br>

## Overview of UEFI

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI), a standard introduced in 2010, has replaced the older Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) as the primary firmware interface for computers. UEFI offers several advancements over BIOS, including:

- **Support for Larger Disks**: UEFI allows for booting from disks larger than those supported by traditional BIOS.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Unlike the text-based BIOS, UEFI often includes a GUI for easier management.
- **Secure Boot**: A feature that enhances security by ensuring that only digitally signed and trusted drivers and OS files are loaded during boot-up.

### Accessing UEFI Firmware Settings

To access UEFI firmware settings on a Linux host, such as a blade server, users typically press a specific keyboard combination during power-up. Common keys include Ctrl+E or F2. This access allows users to configure various settings, including enabling Secure Boot, setting up RAID arrays, and configuring network adapters.

### UEFI Secure Boot

Secure Boot, an optional feature in UEFI, plays a critical role in enhancing security. Its primary purposes are:

- **Verification of Digital Signatures**: Ensures that drivers and OS files are signed and trusted, mitigating the risk of rootkits and other malicious software.
- **Prevention of Unauthorized Code Execution**: Blocks the loading of unsigned or untrusted code, potentially stopping malicious software from running at boot time.

In UEFI, a signature database holds the public keys of trusted certificate authorities (CAs). Users can update these keys to include new trusted entities or sign custom kernel drivers for specialized hardware.

### Considerations for Secure Boot

When using Secure Boot with Linux, consider the following:

- **Compatibility with Installed Operating Systems**: Ensure that any installed OS is compatible with UEFI Secure Boot.
- **Linux Distribution Support**: Verify that the Linux distribution supports UEFI Secure Boot, especially for older versions.

### Boot Screen and Partition Configuration

The GRUB boot loader in Linux provides options for UEFI firmware settings.

A message is shown below it: Try or Install Ubuntu Server. Three options are given below: Ubuntu Server with the HWE kernel, Boot from next volume, and UEFI Firmware Settings. The configuration details are given at the bottom. [Video description ends]

When Linux is installed with Secure Boot enabled, a boot/efi partition (e.g., /dev/sda) is typically created.

### Verifying Secure Boot State

To check if Secure Boot is enabled on a Linux system, the `mokutil` command with `--sb-state` can be used. A positive response indicates that Secure Boot is active.

## Conclusion

UEFI and its Secure Boot feature are integral to hardening Linux environments, ensuring that only trusted software runs on the system. By leveraging these technologies, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture against sophisticated cyber threats.
