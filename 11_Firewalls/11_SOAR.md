# Understanding SOAR in Security Incident Detection and Response

<br>

## Overview

Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) solutions play a crucial role in the response aspect of Security Incident Detection and Response. They are designed to streamline and enhance the efficiency of security operations in an organization.

<br>

### Key Functions of SOAR

- **Incident Response**: Determines and executes responses to security incidents, filtering out irrelevant data.
- **Mitigation Actions**: Identifies suspicious activities and undertakes actions to contain or eradicate threats.
- **Integration with SIEM**: Often coupled with SIEM solutions for comprehensive security management.

### Benefits of SCAP in SOAR

- **SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol)**: Keeps up to date with cybersecurity changes and helps maintain compliance.
- **Automated Comparisons**: Compares network hosts and devices against security baselines for compliance.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automates the management of discovered vulnerabilities and non-compliant devices.

### Understanding Security Indicators

- **False Positives**: Incorrectly indicating a security threat where none exists.
- **True Positives**: Correctly identifying a real and active security threat.
- **False Negatives**: Failing to detect an actual security threat.
- **True Negatives**: Correctly identifying that there is no security threat.

### SOAR Playbooks

- **Automated Incident Response**: Utilizes playbooks for automated action based on identified threats.
- **Decision Branches**: Includes logical decision-making processes based on the nature of the threat (e.g., suspicious emails, URLs, or file attachments).
- **Customizable Actions**: Allows for the configuration of specific actions like deletion of malicious emails, notification of users, and further analysis.

### SIEM and SOAR Integration

- **Data Ingestion and Analysis**: SIEM solutions ingest and analyze data for threat hunting.
- **Incident Response**: SOAR takes over for automated incident response based on SIEM analysis.
- **Comprehensive Security Management**: The integration ensures a more robust and responsive security system.

<br>

### Example: SOAR Playbook Workflow

1. **Start**: Identification of a suspicious email.
2. **Evaluation**: Parsing and evaluation of the email for URLs or attachments.
3. **Branching Logic**:
   - If no URL/attachment, optionally notify the user or take no action.
   - If URL/attachment is present, proceed to further analysis.
4. **Malicious Attachment/URL Detection**:
   - Compute hash of files, compare with databases, or use services like VirusTotal.
   - If malicious, delete email and notify relevant parties.
5. **Automated Decision-Making**: These actions are part of the automated workflow defined in the SOAR playbook.

## Conclusion

SOAR solutions represent an essential component in the modern security infrastructure of organizations. By automating the response to security incidents, SOAR significantly enhances the ability to manage and mitigate potential threats effectively. The integration of SOAR with SIEM systems offers a robust framework for not just identifying security threats but also for responding to them in an automated, efficient, and timely manner. For organizations looking to bolster their security posture, the implementation of SOAR, in conjunction with SIEM, is a strategic imperative.
